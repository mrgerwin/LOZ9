1. Make atleast one more scene for use in our game.
2. Eventually we will be connecting scenes so you will need to make it so that the character can enter your scene and exit your scene in atleast one spot.
3. Move link to a tile where he potentially could enter the scene
4. Place several enemies of different kinds in your scene.  You can write elif statements inside the scene code to do this.  Use characters that are not base64.
5. Test your program and make sure that your scene doesn't introduce any issues with sprite movement.
6. Make sure that your sprites and link do not pass through wall tiles.
